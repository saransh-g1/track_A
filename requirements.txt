# Track A - End-to-End RAG + Reasoning Pipeline Requirements
# Optimized for minimal space and faster installation

# Core Framework (Mandatory)
pathway>=0.7.0

# LLM and Embeddings (Core - Required)
transformers>=4.40.0
torch>=2.0.0
sentence-transformers>=2.3.0
accelerate>=0.30.0

# Quantization (Optional but recommended for memory efficiency)
bitsandbytes>=0.43.0; sys_platform != "darwin"  # Skip on macOS

# Vector Store (Required)
faiss-cpu>=1.7.4  # Use faiss-gpu if you have CUDA and want GPU acceleration

# NLP (Minimal - only NLTK, no spaCy)
nltk>=3.8.0

# Utilities (Minimal set)
numpy>=1.24.0
tqdm>=4.66.0
